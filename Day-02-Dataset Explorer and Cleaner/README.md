## ‚ú® Features

* **CSV Upload**: Easily upload your dataset in CSV format.
* **Dataset Preview**: View the first few rows of your original and cleaned datasets.
* **Initial Statistics**: Get a quick overview of your dataset's shape, missing values, column types, and basic descriptive statistics before cleaning.
* **Missing Data Handling**:
    * Drop rows with any missing values.
    * Impute missing values using Mean, Median, Mode, KNN, Forward Fill (`ffill`), or Backward Fill (`bfill`).
* **Duplicate Data Handling**:
    * Remove exact duplicate rows from your dataset.
* **Outlier Detection & Treatment**:
    * Identify and remove outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
    * Cap outliers (Winsorization) using the IQR method.
* **Data Type Corrections**:
    * Convert selected columns to `datetime` format.
* **Standardization & Normalization**:
    * Scale numerical data using `StandardScaler` (Z-score normalization).
    * Scale numerical data using `MinMaxScaler` (normalize to \[0, 1] range).
* **Post-Cleaning Statistics**: View statistics (missing values, types, descriptive stats) for the dataset **after** applying cleaning operations to assess their impact.
* **Download Cleaned Data**: Download the processed dataset as a new CSV file.

    cd Day-02-Dataset Explorer and Cleaner
    ```
  

2.  **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the directory** where you saved `app.py` in your terminal or command prompt.
