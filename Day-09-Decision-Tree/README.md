# ðŸŒ³ Project 09 - Decision Tree from Scratch

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** manually using **NumPy**.  
It works by calculating **entropy & information gain** at each split.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Activate your environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

2. Go to the project folder:
    cd Day-09-Decision-Tree


3. Run the script: 
    python decision_tree_scratch.py


## âœ¨ Example Output

âœ… Accuracy: 1.00


## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

Understand entropy & information gain.

Implement recursive decision tree building.

Learn how models make decisions step by step.
