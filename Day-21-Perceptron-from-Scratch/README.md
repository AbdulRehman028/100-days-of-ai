# ðŸ§  Day 21 â€“ Perceptron from Scratch

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **single-layer perceptron** â€” the simplest form of a neural network â€” using only **NumPy**.  
Youâ€™ll understand how **weights**, **bias**, and **activation functions** work together to make binary decisions.


## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Activate your environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

2. Navigate to the folder:

    cd Day-21-Perceptron-from-Scratch

3. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run:

    python perceptron_scratch.py

# ðŸ“ˆ Example Output
Epoch 0: Total Error = 6
Epoch 10: Total Error = 2
Epoch 20: Total Error = 1
...
âœ… Training Complete!
Final Weights: [0.51 0.42]
Final Bias: [0.13]

ðŸ“Š Predictions:
Study=4, Sleep=6 â†’ 0
Study=8, Sleep=2 â†’ 1
