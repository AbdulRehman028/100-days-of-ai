# ðŸ¤– Day 22 â€“ Perceptron Using Scikit-Learn

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll learn how to implement a **Perceptron classifier** using **Scikit-Learn** â€” a high-level library that automates model training, scaling, and evaluation.  
This builds directly on Day 21, where you implemented a perceptron manually.
