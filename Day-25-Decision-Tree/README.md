# ðŸŒ³ Day 25 - Decision Tree Classifier

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-Learn.  
It predicts whether a person buys a computer based on categorical features like age, income, student status, and credit rating.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Activate environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
2. Navigate to the project folder:

    cd Day-25-Decision-Tree

3. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the project:

    python decision_tree_classifier.py

# ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Label encoding for categorical data

- Training a DecisionTreeClassifier

- Visualizing decision trees

- Calculating accuracy & classification reports

- Understanding entropy-based splits

# ðŸ“Š Example Output

âœ… Data Loaded Successfully:
     age income student credit_rating buys_computer
0  <=30   high      no          fair            no
1  <=30   high      no     excellent            no
...

ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy: 1.0
ðŸ“„ Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       1.00      1.00      1.00         2
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00         2

ðŸ§  Prediction for [[1, 2, 1, 0]]: 1 (1=Yes, 0=No)
