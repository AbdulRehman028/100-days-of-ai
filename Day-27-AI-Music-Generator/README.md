# 🎵 AI Music Generator using LSTM

This project generates **music sequences** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)** trained on MIDI files.

## 🧠 Features
- Reads and processes MIDI files using `music21`
- Trains an LSTM neural network on musical note sequences
- Generates new, original note sequences
- Exports generated music as a `.mid` file
