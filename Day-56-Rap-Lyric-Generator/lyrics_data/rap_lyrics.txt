[Theme: Hustle]
I wake up every morning with a mission on my mind
Grinding through the struggle leaving yesterday behind
Stack the paper up, never let them see me fall
Built this empire brick by brick, standing ten feet tall
Every setback is a setup for a comeback twice as strong
Writing history in the making, this is where I belong

[Theme: Hustle]
Started from the bottom now I'm climbing every day
They doubted every step but I kept walking anyway
The city lights are calling and the money never sleeps
I plant the seeds of greatness and I harvest what I reap
No shortcuts on this highway, I do it the hard way
Every hour of the grind is building up my payday

[Theme: Street Life]
Corner store philosophy from scholars of the block
Midnight conversations while we're watching for the cops
Streetlights flicker, another story unfolds
The truth is always bitter but the lies feel like gold
Concrete jungle where the strong survive the night
Every shadow has a story, every corner has a fight

[Theme: Street Life]
Sidewalk sermons from the preacher on the stoop
Kids are playing hopscotch while the sirens loop
Grandma's cooking dinner, smell it down the hall
Murals painted beautiful on every broken wall
This neighborhood made me, every crack and every scar
Even broken pavement leads you to a star

[Theme: Dreams]
I've been dreaming of the day when the world knows my name
When the verses that I write turn into eternal flame
Chasing clouds of purple haze through silver-lined skies
The vision in my head is clearer than these tired eyes
They told me I should quit and get a regular career
But the music in my soul is the only voice I hear

[Theme: Dreams]
Close my eyes and picture everything I want to be
Penthouse view, the ocean, total serenity
But the grind won't let me rest, the hunger keeps me up
Pouring rhymes into the mic like coffee in a cup
Manifestation station, I believe it so it's true
Every single dream I had is slowly coming through

[Theme: Love]
She walked in like a melody I'd never heard before
Every word she spoke was like a key to every door
Heart was beating drum lines in a rhythm built for two
In a world of black and white, she painted everything blue
Late night conversations, stars replacing ceiling lights
She's the chorus to my verses, she makes everything right

[Theme: Love]
We were strangers in the rain under neon-colored lights
She smiled and the city noise went quiet for the night
Her laughter is a sample that I loop inside my head
Every moment with her feels like every word unsaid
Two hearts beating bass lines in a symphony of trust
In a world that's filled with rust she's the gold beneath the dust

[Theme: Flex]
Pull up in the chariot, the engine start to roar
Diamond-studded confidence, they never seen before
Ice around my wrist like winter came in June
Every beat I step on turns into a platinum tune
They talk but never walk it, I'm the proof inside the booth
Every bar I spit is nothing but the truth

[Theme: Flex]
Chain heavy, pockets loaded, yeah the lifestyle's elite
Every verse I drop is fire, feel the heat in the street
Designer on the outside, warrior within
Champagne celebrations, let the winning begin
They wanna know the secret but the recipe is sealed
Hard work mixed with talent on a never-ending reel

[Theme: Struggle]
Mama worked two jobs just to keep the lights on
Dinner was a prayer answered when the check was gone
Hand-me-down ambition, secondhand respect
But I took the broken pieces and I built an architect
Struggle is the teacher and the lesson is the pain
Every single tear I shed became a drop of rain

[Theme: Struggle]
Empty refrigerator, full imagination
Living in survival mode across the nation
Bills piled up like skyscrapers in the sky
But I learned to build a ladder every time they asked me why
The weight upon my shoulders made my backbone strong
This struggle is the intro to my victory song

[Theme: Party]
DJ spin that record let the bass line drop
Whole club jumping, yeah we never gonna stop
Hands up in the air like we just don't care
Confetti in the spotlight, magic everywhere
Friday night is calling and the speakers start to bump
Every single soul in here is feeling the jump

[Theme: Party]
Bottle service, VIP, the night is young
Turn the music up until we feel it in our lungs
Dancing like tomorrow doesn't even exist
Neon lights and laser beams cutting through the mist
The rhythm takes control and everybody moves
Life is just a party when you're locked into the groove

[Theme: Legacy]
When I'm gone I want the words to echo through the years
A library of verses built from joy and fears
Every page a chapter of the story that I've lived
The gift of honest music is the greatest I can give
Legacy is measured not by wealth but by the hearts
You touch with every lyric, every verse, every part

[Theme: Legacy]
Carve my name in marble made of beats and rhymes
A monument to every word I spit between the lines
When the final curtain falls and the stage goes dark
Remember that the music was a flame, not a spark
I came, I saw, I conquered every single beat
Left my footprints tattooed on every single street

[Theme: Hustle]
Alarm clock at five, no time for hesitation
Building up my kingdom with relentless dedication
Coffee black as midnight, focus sharp as steel
Every single obstacle is just another wheel
Turning me towards destiny, I see it crystal clear
The top is getting closer with every passing year

[Theme: Confidence]
I walk in any room and own the atmosphere
Every word I speak is engineered to persevere
They tried to write me off but I'm the author of the book
One look is all it takes, go ahead and take a look
Self-made, self-paid, the blueprint is my DNA
I'm the definition of a legendary day

[Theme: Confidence]
Mirror mirror on the wall, I already know the truth
Every scar upon my skin is living breathing proof
That I survived the fires, walked through every storm
Came out the other side in legendary form
Talk is cheap but action speaks in volumes that are loud
I'm the lightning and the thunder breaking through the cloud

[Theme: Night Life]
City never sleeps and neither do the dreamers here
Midnight is the canvas, neon paint is crystal clear
Every rooftop has a view of possibilities
The skyline is a playlist full of melodies
Bass bumping from the underground to penthouses above
The night belongs to those who do the things they love

[Theme: Night Life]
Three AM the city got a different kind of pulse
Running through the avenues on pure adrenaline results
Taxicabs and limousines all racing through the dark
Every intersection is an after-midnight spark
The moon becomes the spotlight for the ones who come alive
When the sun goes down, that's when we truly thrive

[Theme: Motivation]
Get up, get out, and get something going
The seeds you plant today are the gardens you'll be growing
No excuses, no delays, just put the work in
Every champion was once a beginner who kept searching
The mountain looks impossible until you start the climb
One step at a time, one bar at a time, one rhyme at a time

[Theme: Motivation]
Stop waiting for permission, give it to yourself
Your potential's gathering dust up on the shelf
Take it down and use it, let the fire burn
Every lesson that you learn is another page to turn
The world will try to stop you, let it fuel the flame
You didn't come this far to only come this far — reclaim your name

[Theme: Reality]
Not everything that glitters has a golden core
Behind the fame and fortune there's a revolving door
The pressure of perfection weighs a thousand tons
Smiling for the cameras while inside you want to run
Reality is brutal but it keeps you grounded, friend
The real ones stay beside you from beginning to the end

[Theme: Reality]
Social media painted pictures that are never real
Filters on the trauma, nobody shows how they feel
Behind the highlight reel there's a blooper tape of pain
Sunshine after midnight only comes after the rain
Keep it one hundred, that's the code I live by
Real recognize real, no need to justify
