  "story": "It was supposed to be the perfect escape for her - a chance to leave behind the stress of teaching, the chaos of everyday life, and take a well-deserved break from all things school-related. She had made a mental note to visit this new location after class today, but something about this particular escape room wasn't sitting right with her. The bright lights of the place were just as harsh as they looked online, shimmering against the dark walls around her. The air smelled like stale sweat mixed with metal and sawdust, and she could feel the weight of it pressing down on her shoulders as she squeezed through one of the thick glass doors into the dimly lit interior. The sounds of her own breathing echoed off the walls, adding to the eerie silence. Her eyes widened at the sight before her, and her heart spun a little faster with excitement and fear. There were puzzles scattered around the space, each one more challenging than the last. But there was also the promise of reward - a small wooden box, full of delicious looking cookies! And she couldn't resist the temptation of reaching out and picking up one, despite the warnings of the others in her group. Without even thinking, she reached out and picked up a cookie. As soon as it hit her tongue, she felt a jolt of electricity course through her body. Suddenly everything went black, and when she opened her eyes again, everything looked different. Her head was spinning with an intense feeling, and then she heard someone call her name. She shook herself awake, blinking at the glare of the light above her. She knew now what had happened - she had been transported to an alternate reality where the island existed in their own world, and the box contained a map leading to another dimension entirely. The room was filled with intricate carvings and depictions of mythical creatures that she recognized, some of which belonged to a fantasy series she wrote years ago. At first, she tried to make sense of what she was seeing. The puzzle pieces seemed interconnected somehow, making the impossible seem possible. Soon enough, however, the realization dawned on her; this was no dream, no imagination.",
