Surprising Twist/Punchline: The mysterious malfunction might have something to do with my poor coding practices. Number 1 - \"I hate programming\" -> \"My computer keeps restarting itself, even when I don't touch it.\"",
    "Rule #2: Writing code is hard work...and rewarding! Example : When you finally finish your first program, feel free to celebrate by taking up a new hobby like baking or rock climbing! Twist/ Punchline:- While writing a complex algorithm, you might accidentally find yourself in another room where the walls seem to stretch infinitely, leaving you feeling unsure if you made any progress"
